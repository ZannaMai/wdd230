            Family Search is a good example of using white space and having a
            clean design because it utilizes it in a way were you know where
            their important content is. I enjoy this site because it doesn't
            bombard you with a lot of information, but it gives you what is most
            important and guides you easily where you want to go.

            Lume is a website for natural deodorant that I have come across and
            I remember it mostly because of its use of colors on their website.
            I believe this website has good contrast because the colors allow
            the reader to easily read what is on the page and it allows grabs
            the users attention easily with the color pallette.

            Youtube is an easy choice for proximity. This website is all about
            video content so they know that it is importamt to out things close
            together, but also make it so the user can easily choose where they
            want to go. Their buttons aren't far apart so you can choose what
            sort of ocntent you want to see and the search bar is also close by
            so the user can easily search for the content that they want to see.
